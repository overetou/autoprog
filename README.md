# autoprog
Perform basic programation tasks automatically.

## IMPORTANT: The program encounters problems on big projects. This should be fixed soon.

example (and only usage for now):
```
./autoprog tidy prototypes
```

There are also a few bash scripts that will later be incorporated in the command.
